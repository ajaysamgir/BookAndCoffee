I was in a library yesterday and that face glared at me from a book stand. I couldn't resist. I'm already halfway through this and it's a cracking read. Bear isn't a gifted writer by any means, but his very honest, simple prose suits the story being told. I already knew a bit about Bear, as the army is a fairly tight-knit organization. I knew he'd been to Eton, that he was in the SAS(R) and that he was a committed Christian, and of course I've watched most of his shows. But what's been fascinating about this book is that the Bear you want to exist..a very humble, very fun guy who never boasts about anything in his life but has an unbelievable inner core strength, actually exists. What you see is what you get. I loved the early parts in this book about Bear's great-grandfather, a writer who--along with Kipling--pretty much defined what is it to be a gentleman, a man. I'll update when I've finished but so far I'd class this as mandatory reading for all men.
Finished.
I feel the need to read a biography of Bear now, if one exists. This guy is so incredibly modest that you don't actually get the full impact of his life and achievements until you close the last page, then you open it again and go... On top of being in the SAS(R), climbing Everest, Bear glosses quickly over crossing the frozen North Atlantic Arctic Ocean, going through training for the Legion, a global audience for his shows of 1.2 billion, writing 11 books (two best sellers), launching a global business, becoming a Lt Cdr in the RN, leading expeditions to the Antarctic, raising millions of pounds for charity and becoming the Chief Scout.
Bear...kudos, man.
I defy anyone to read this autobiography and not come away inspired to be just a slightly better man. No, I can't go back and pass SAS selection. I can't climb Everest. The Arctic is out. Similarly the southern cold place. Best-selling books...still working on that one. But I don't feel defeated at all by these inadequacies after reading this book. Bear's just that kind of guy.
Compulsory read.

Bear Grylls, the famous adventurer, will never cease to impress. My expectations, which were very high, were fulfilled and exceeded far beyond any limit.

The most humble, modest man doesn't seem at all changed from his new role as a celebrity. He tends to shun away from any kind of publicity and declined the offer to be the main star of "Man vs Wild" three times, before finally accepting to shoot a pilot, something he hasn't regretted, I'm sure. The thing with people like Bear is that you really get to know him during reading because he opens up totally.
The most important thing is that he is honest. He tells the reader everything, not only the good, innocent parts.

This book is funny, sad and thrilling:

It's funny because he seems such a smiling guy that always stands up for his friends and family. Hence, he has got many friends. Not a single time in the entire book has he written something negative about someone. He sees the good in people, and emphasizes it. For that matter, he might not agree with everyone. He has a strong self-respect and never diverge from his morals and values in life.

It's sad because he has lost people he loves and he honours them beautifully. The kind of life he has chosen has small marginals, a balance between life and death. He cried on at least ten places in the book, either from grief or from the risk of never seeing his family again.

It's tremendously thrilling. His training and the SAS selection was exciting, since it's often considered so secretive. (He didn't reveal anything he shouldn't, and left out the details I had so looked forward to read. But he had to run it by the SAS for approval, and it couldn't involve anything confidential.) What a horrifying experience, people have died of plain exhaustion, trying to get in!

I couldn't stop reading when the nutcase decided to climb Mount Everest only months after breaking his back in three places in a parachute accident. I mean, come on! Enough is enough!

His constant expeditions seem to serve as encouragement, fuel, to his ever present love for challenges. And at the end of every adventure, he acknowledges the lessons needed to be learned and wisely reinforces his knowledge.

This is a great inspiration! Grylls is proof that you can achieve anything with perseverance and a strong mind. The sky has no limit.

At first, it came across as being poorly written technically. But as the book wore on, I realized that he intended the book to come across as if he were speaking to an audience, not writing a book. Once I recognized his style, I appreciated the book for what it was and thoroughly liked it. Plenty of stories which add color to Bear and what made him who he is today. His values come through strongly. Amazing to think of what he accomplished. I wish he gave more details on his SAS qualification but secrecy prevents that. Story of his climb on Everest is very gripping. Gives a very logical explanation at the end regarding Man vs Wild and its philosophy against the recent criticism of it.

The chapters are extremely short and there's a ton of them (100+) to make up a 300-400 page book. Font is large and pages aren't completely filled so the book takes up a lot more paper and space than it needs to. Nevertheless, quality book. Recommended for those who enjoy adventure, especially for those who enjoy the outdoors. May take a little to get used to the writing style.
